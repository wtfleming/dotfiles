disable mission control since I use those keyboard shortcuts in emacs
Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control and change the settings for "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" or disable them completely.

# Install java 21

$ brew install openjdk@21
For the system Java wrappers to find this JDK, symlink it with
  sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk.jdk

openjdk is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS provides similar software and installing this software in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have openjdk first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find openjdk you may need to set:
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/include"

# asdf
See https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html

brew install coreutils curl git

git clone https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf.git ~/.asdf --branch v0.14.0

Add the following to ~/.zshrc:

. "$HOME/.asdf/asdf.sh"

Completions are configured by either a ZSH Framework asdf plugin or by adding the following to your .zshrc:

# append completions to fpath
fpath=(${ASDF_DIR}/completions $fpath)
# initialise completions with ZSH's compinit
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit

if you are using a custom compinit setup, ensure compinit is below your sourcing of asdf.sh
if you are using a custom compinit setup with a ZSH Framework, ensure compinit is below your sourcing of the framework

# Erlang/Elixir
On an INTEL mac modal popups from the OS will flash on the screen often.
If youâ€™re using asdf, you can workaround this issue by disabling jit by adding:
export KERL_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS="--disable-jit"
to your .bashrc/.zshrc before installing erlang.

This doesn't affect ARM macs, and a workaround will probably be in erlang/OTP 27
