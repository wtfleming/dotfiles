Install dev tools - this is one way to prompt it:
git --version

brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitexcludes

$ brew update
$ brew install emacs --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-rsvg --with-imagemagick
# $ brew install emacs --with-cocoa
$ brew linkapps emacs

To have launchd start emacs now and restart at login:
  brew services start emacs
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  emacs

emacs flyspell needs a spell checking tool, install one on os x

brew install ispell --with-lang-en

brew install elixir

disable mission control since I use those keyboard shortcuts in emacs
Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control and change the settings for "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" or disable them completely.
