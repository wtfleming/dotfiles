Install dev tools - this is one way to prompt it:
git --version

brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitexcludes

# emacs https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS#toc14
$ brew update
$ brew cask install emacs

# To update
$ brew cask upgrade


To have launchd start emacs now and restart at login:
  brew services start emacs
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  emacs

emacs flyspell needs a spell checking tool, install one on os x

brew install ispell --with-lang-en


disable mission control since I use those keyboard shortcuts in emacs
Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Mission Control and change the settings for "Move left a space" and "Move right a space" or disable them completely.
